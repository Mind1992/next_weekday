# Next Weekday
## About
This project is for [Epicodus'](http://www.epicodus.com/) [JavaScript BDD assessment](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/javascript-bdd-assessment).
A webpage that allows users to input a day of the week (like Friday) and return the date of the next occurrence (like 7/11/2014). If a user enters the current day, it should return the date of a week from today - not today.

The webpage also allows users to input a weekday (like Monday) and a month (like January) and return all the dates of that weekday in the given month in the current year.
## Setup
Clone this repository or download the .zip and open up the index.html file in the browser.
