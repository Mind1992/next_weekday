<h1>Next Weekday</h1>
<p>A webpage that allows users to input a day of the week (like Friday) and return the date of the next occurrence (like 7/11/2014). If a user enters the current day, it should return the date of a week from today - not today.</p>
<br>
<p>The webpage also allows users to input a weekday (like Monday) and a month (like January) and return all the dates of that weekday in the given month in 2014</p>
